This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights into passenger demographics, ticket fares, survival rates, and relationships between various features.

Key Steps in the Analysis:
Data Loading & Overview: Reads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file and displays the first few rows, summary statistics, and dataset information.

Univariate Analysis:

Plots the distribution of passenger ages using a histogram with a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate).

Displays a boxplot of ticket fares to examine fare distribution and outliers.

Correlation Analysis:

Calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix of numeric features using a heatmap.

Multivariate Analysis:

Creates a pairplot to explore relationships between age, fare, passenger class, and survival, colored by survival status.

Uses count plots to compare survival rates across different genders and passenger classes.

Interactive Visualization:

An interactive histogram is generated using Plotly to compare the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.

This analysis provides visual and statistical insights that are essential for understanding the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.
